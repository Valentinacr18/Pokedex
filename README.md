I made this project as part of my learning in web development, with the goal of practicing the consumption of public APIs and working with dynamic data. I chose to create a Pok√©dex because it is a fun, visual and very useful project to practice key concepts such as:

- HTTP requests with JavaScript.

- Manipulating the DOM dynamically.

- Designing interactive cards to display information.
